## SuperScanner
A Raspberry Pi 3 with a Flatbed Scanner to send scans via button pushing to a mailadress.
It's also connected to a USB LCD display (also in this repo) that shows the current status.
[There's a German tutorial to build one yourself](https://wiki.das-labor.org/w/Projekt/Server_Scripte#SuperScanner )
